# Store API

Store API is a REST API made in Javascript with Express and PostgreSQL for a store (mini store).


This API allows you to:

- List, create, update and delete products
- List, create (with a role), update and delete users

The users (with the client role) can create a shopping kart and adding or removing available products.
